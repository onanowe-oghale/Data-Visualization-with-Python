<h1>DATA VISUALIZATON FOR POINTS GOTTEN FROM LOOSING POSITIONS BY PL TEAMS FROM THE 2020/21 TO THE 2022/23 SEASON</h1>


<P>Was inspired to visualize the project thank to my love for the sport. Also took data from Transmarkt.com.
The project compares the three Premier league seaons(2020/21, 2021/22 and 2022/23) and compares the points gotten by all 20 PL teams
from loosing position(i.e being a goal or more down )across the three seasons visualizes their data while they are compared to each other. </P>
